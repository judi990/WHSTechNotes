Speed, Acceleration,and Direction.
Speed is how fast the robot goes and the speed you can caculate and you can program the speed of the 
robot and the speed is the direction, and the time, speed for the robot to move at a particular speed for a particular amount of time, and then measure how far it has gone.

I could have change how my journal was and did better on my intro and wrote a little more then what i
wrote.
The whole thing was unclear and confusing to me and i didn't get any of it.
I encounter a lot of challenges while following those steps. how to get to the journal what to do on the journal how to do 
the journal. getting the journal and i missed how to get to the journal.

Precision can be seen as a measure of quality, and recall as a measure of quantity. Higher precision means that an algorithm returns more relevant results than irrelevant ones, and high recall means that an algorithm returns most of the relevant results (whether or not irrelevant ones are also returned).
If steps are missed you are going to get lost on what your doing and you will be confused like me when i can't find out how to get to the coding and how to do the coding so if you missed the details and instructions you are cooked.
It is important to develop good habits so you can do more and go far with what your doing and so you can pay attention to details 
early in your coding journey so you can learn how to code better and get better at coding.

Computer science is used to get you to know how to work a computer and computer science is also used for learning and discover more and new websites and apps
but i love Computer science it is a good way for me to learn more about computer's just in case i change my mind about football and come to computer's the class in good and the computer's
are even better github that is one of the apps where it is usfull and helpfull so computer science is a good class to take and also the reason computer science is helpfull for its Using those tools, computer science allows us to predict hurricanes, tornadoes, or even the outbreak of a potentially fatal disease. It can even be used to predict human behavior, which can help prevent crimes. Computer science can provide us with some life-saving tools and work.

When you're coding, you're often faced with complex problems. In order to solve these problems, you need to break them down into smaller, more manageable steps. This process of breaking down problems is a valuable skill that can be applied to other areas of your life. Coding teaches you to think logically.
Coding skills have become valuable across various industries. While it's beneficial for tech-related careers, coding enhances problem-solving, logical thinking, and creativity, which are applicable in diverse fields like finance, healthcare, and even the arts.
Programming languages foster student creativity by encouraging problem-solving, supporting personal and collaborative projects, enabling experimentation, and providing practical applications. They empower students to think innovatively and express creativity through code.
Coding knowledge can benefit professionals across various fields, including marketing by automating email campaigns, finance by creating custom financial models, healthcare by analyzing patient data, research by developing data analysis tools, and even in creative fields like design by enabling interactive prototypes; essentially, anyone who works with data or needs to automate repetitive tasks can benefit from coding skills, allowing them to streamline workflows and increase efficiency in their respective roles, potentially leading to career advancement and greater impact within their industry.

AI improves efficiency and innovation in industries like healthcare, education, and transportation by analyzing vast amounts of data to identify patterns, enabling predictive modeling, automating repetitive tasks, and providing personalized insights, ultimately leading to better decision-making, optimized operations, and enhanced customer experiences across these sectors; for example, in healthcare, AI can assist with diagnosis, drug discovery, and personalized treatment plans, while in education it can tailor learning paths to individual student needs, and in transportation, AI can optimize routes, predict traffic patterns, and facilitate autonomous driving. 
Some key risks associated with AI include: job automation, where AI could replace human workers in certain industries; bias in algorithms, leading to discriminatory outcomes based on the data used to train them; cybersecurity threats, where malicious actors could exploit AI systems to launch sophisticated attacks; data breaches due to the large amounts of sensitive information AI systems process; lack of transparency in decision-making processes, making it difficult to understand how AI reaches its conclusions; and amplification of existing biases present in the data used to train AI models.

 Remixed Foundation Marketing found that 73% of online users share content to help them connect with others with the same interests after  Overall, just over half of US adults (54%) say they at least sometimes get news from social media, up slightly compared with the last few years Digital publishing, also called electronic or online publishing, is the distribution of a variety of online content, such as journals, magazines, newspapers.
  There are many different ways to use social media for education, so we've identified 15 ways to use it, inside and outside the classroom You should carefully consider the ramifications of sharing information about a project on social media, even if it's not confidential  Writing is the most established way to share your research findings. Benefits of writing include the ability to proofread, edit, and rewrite to get your Use family consent/opt-out forms. If you're planning on sharing activities happening in your classroom, get consent from parents or caregivers. However, if sensitive data falls into the wrong hands, it can lead to fraud, identity theft, or similar harms. Given the cost of a security breach—losing your customers' trust and perhaps even defending yourself against a lawsuit—safeguarding personal information is just plain good business.
