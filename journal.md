Precision can be seen as a measure of quality, and recall as a measure of quantity. Higher precision means that an algorithm returns more relevant results than irrelevant ones, and high recall means that an algorithm returns most of the relevant results (whether or not irrelevant ones are also returned).
If steps are missed you are going to get lost on what your doing and you will be confused like me when i can't find out how to get to the coding and how to do the coding so if you missed the details and instructions you are cooked.
It is important to develop good habits so you can do more and go far with what your doing and so you can pay attention to details 
early in your coding journey so you can learn how to code better and get better at coding.

Computer science is used to get you to know how to work a computer and computer science is also used for learning and discover more and new websites and apps
but i love Computer science it is a good way for me to learn more about computer's just in case i change my mind about football and come to computer's the class in good and the computer's
are even better github that is one of the apps where it is usfull and helpfull so computer science is a good class to take and also the reason computer science is helpfull for its Using those tools, computer science allows us to predict hurricanes, tornadoes, or even the outbreak of a potentially fatal disease. It can even be used to predict human behavior, which can help prevent crimes. Computer science can provide us with some life-saving tools and work.
